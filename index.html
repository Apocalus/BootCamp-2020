        Centuries ago, mankind was slaughtered to near extinction by monstrous humanoid creatures called titans, 
        forcing humans to hide in fear behind enormous concentric walls. What makes these giants truly terrifying is 
        that their taste for human flesh is not born out of hunger but what appears to be out of pleasure. 
        <mark>To ensure their survival, the remnants of humanity began living within defensive barriers, resulting in 
        one hundred years without a single titan encounter. However, that fragile calm is soon shattered when a 
        colossal titan manages to breach the supposedly impregnable outer wall, reigniting the fight for survival 
        against the man-eating abominations.</mark>

        <mark>After witnessing a horrific personal loss at the hands of the invading creatures, Eren Yeager dedicates his 
        life to their eradication by enlisting into the Survey Corps, an elite military unit that combats the merciless 
        humanoids outside the protection of the walls.</mark> Based on Hajime Isayama's award-winning manga, Shingeki no Kyojin 
        follows Eren, along with his adopted sister Mikasa Ackerman and his childhood friend Armin Arlert, as they join 
        the brutal war against the titans and race to discover a way of defeating them before the last walls are breached.

            For centuries, humanity has been hunted by giant, mysterious predators known as the Titans. 
            Three mighty walls—Wall Maria, Rose, and Sheena—provided peace and protection for humanity for over a hundred years. 
            That peace, however, was shattered when the Colossus Titan and Armored Titan appeared and destroyed the outermost wall, 
            Wall Maria. Forced to retreat behind Wall Rose, humanity waited with bated breath for the Titans to reappear and destroy 
            their safe haven once more.

            In Shingeki no Kyojin Season 2, <mark>Eren Yeager and others of the 104th Training Corps have just begun to become 
            full members of the Survey Corps. As they ready themselves to face the Titans once again, their preparations 
            are interrupted by the invasion of Wall Rose—but all is not as it seems as more mysteries are unraveled. 
            As the Survey Corps races to save the wall, they uncover more about the invading Titans and the dark secrets 
            of their own members.</mark>

            Still threatened by the "Titans" that rob them of their freedom, mankind remains caged inside the two remaining walls. 
            Efforts to eradicate these monsters continue; however, threats arise not only from the Titans beyond the walls, but 
            from the humans within them as well.

            After being rescued from the Colossal and Armored Titans, Eren Yaeger devotes himself to improving his Titan form. 
            Krista Lenz struggles to accept the loss of her friend, Captain Levi chooses Eren and his friends to form his new personal 
            squad, and Commander Erwin Smith recovers from his injuries. All seems well for the soldiers, until the government suddenly 
            demands custody of Eren and Krista. The Survey Corps' recent successes have drawn attention, and a familiar face from Levi's 
            past is sent to collect the wanted soldiers. Sought after by the government, Levi and his new squad must evade their adversaries 
            in hopes of keeping Eren and Krista safe.
            
            In Shingeki no Kyojin Season 3, <mark>Eren and his fellow soldiers are not only fighting for their survival against the 
            terrifying Titans, but also against the terror of a far more conniving foe: humans.</mark>
